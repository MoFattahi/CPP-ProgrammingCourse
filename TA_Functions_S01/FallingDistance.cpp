/* 
Falling Distance
When an object is falling because of gravity, the following formula can be used to determine the distance the object falls in a specific time period:
d = (1/2)*g*(t^2)
The variables in the formula are as follows: d is the distance in meters, g is 9.8, and t
is the amount of time, in seconds, that the object has been falling.
Write a function named fallingDistance that accepts an objectâ€™s falling time (in seconds) as an argument. The function should return the distance, in meters, that the object has fallen during that time interval. Write a program that demonstrates the function by calling it in a loop that passes the values 1 through 10 as arguments and displays the return value.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

double fallingDistance(int);

int main()
{
    for (int l=1; l<=10; l++)
    {
        cout << "Falling Distance: " << fallingDistance(l) << endl; 
    }
}

double fallingDistance(int time)
{
    double g = 9.8;
    double distance = (1.0/2) * g * pow(time , 2);
    return distance;
